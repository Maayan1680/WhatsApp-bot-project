## Integration with WhatsApp Bot

This frontend is designed to work with the WhatsApp bot backend. The bot sends a link to this web application when a user sends "show tasks" in the WhatsApp chat. The link includes the date parameter, which automatically shows tasks for that specific date.

## Customization

- The application uses CSS variables for easy theme customization (see `src/styles/index.css`)
- WhatsApp-inspired design with the signature green colors
- Easily adaptable for different academic contexts
